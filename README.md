# pebble-teatime

This is an application for the [Pebble Smartwatch](https://developer.getpebble.com/) to help you avoid over-brewing your tea.

It's built for SDK version 2 BETA 4 - so it won't run unless you've flashed your watch to run that version of the OS. Until the app store is up and running you can find a binary [here](http://teatime.blighty.com/teatime.pbw).

As well as being a fairly useful app, it also demonstrates how to do some things with the pebble runtime, including communication with javascript running on the phone, local storage for preferences, javascript based configuration and use of MenuLayer, TextLayer and Timers.

Current source is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/wttw/pebble-teatime).
